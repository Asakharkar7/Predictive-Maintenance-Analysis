Predictive Maintenance Analysis 

Overview

This project focuses on Predictive Maintenance using machine learning models to analyze equipment conditions in the industry. We aim to predict maintenance needs before failure, optimizing equipment lifespan and ensuring safety and productivity.

Dataset

We used the Predictive Maintenance Dataset from the UCI ML website, a synthetic dataset reflective of real industry scenarios. It includes data on various parameters like air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, and torque.

Models Implemented

1. Logistic Regression

2. Na√Øve Bayes

3. Decision Tree Classifier
   
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Features

1. Air and Process Temperature

2. Rotational Speed

3. Torque

4. Tool Wear

5. Machine Failure Indicators

Methods

1. Our analysis involved extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and applying machine learning models.
2. We utilized histograms, pair plots, line plots, heatmaps, and other visualization techniques for insightful data analysis.

Results

The project successfully demonstrates the implementation of various models, with logistic regression showing the best performance based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
